          As a skilled Full Stack Developer with experience building scalable,
          secured, and high-performing applications, I am passionate about
          creating innovative and efficient solutions to complex problems. With
          a background in Banking and Finance, Supply Chain, and an MBA, I bring
          a unique perspective to my work that is grounded in business strategy
          and customer needs.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          I have experience collaborating remotely in cross-functional teams,
          contributing to code bases, as well as refactoring legacy code to
          improve maintainability and efficiency. I have also worked on personal
          projects using technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js,
          Express.js, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          As a Service Manager at Sterling Bank Plc, I gained experience working
          in a fast-paced environment, managing a team of more than 10 members,
          and providing first-level support maintenance and streamlined
          processes that led to a significant increase in account openings. I
          have brought along with me these experiences in my software
          development journey.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          With a Full Stack Web Development Program and 1300+ hours of
          experience mastering algorithms and data structures, I have honed my
          skills in remote pair programming, code reviews, and communication and
          collaboration with international remote developers. My Project
          Management and ITIL Certifications have also taught me to follow a
          project from client description to deployment.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          I am eager to continue growing as a developer and working on
          challenging projects that make a positive impact.
